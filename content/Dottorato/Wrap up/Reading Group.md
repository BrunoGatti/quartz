Does fine tuning llms on new knowledge encourage hallucinations?

this is true (to some extent) and they propose a methodology called slick that is a classification of knowledge cathegory.
"not known", "weakly known", "maybe known" and "highly known" based on the probability that the llm responds correctly.
